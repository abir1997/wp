# Programming an ecommerce site.
Used semantic HTML5,CSS3 and JavaScript(ES6) for front-end to code a minimalistic ecommerce website keeping design principles in mind.
Used PHP to make the webpages dynamic and make the site read data from a .txt file.
JavaScript and PHP was used for data validation where appropriate keeping user security in mind.
